# DAP02 - Investigate a dataset
This project involves the use of NumPy, Pandas, MatPlotlib, Seaborn and Python to analyse a dataset. The dataset I choose was the Titanic Dataset provided by Kaggle.

This repository contains:
- copy of the dataset "titanic_data.csv"
- HTML version of the report "Titanic Dataset Investigation.html"
- iPython notebook - used to generate the report "Titanic Dataset Investigation.ipynb"

An online version of the report can be viewed here: [Online Report](http://ghunt03.github.io/DAProjects/DAP02/TitanicDatasetInvestigation.html)
